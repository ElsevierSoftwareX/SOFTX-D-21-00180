# TimeAwareBPMN-editor

Implementation of a BPMN web editor extended to edit
time-aware BPMN processes. This is the client of the **TimeAwareBPMN-js** tool, a Node.JS application to perform temporal verifications of BPMN models.

## About

The **TimeAwareBPMN-editor** enables the edition of process models enriched with temporal constraints defined on BPMN elements. It contains a toolbar that allows the user to choose how to verify the process models with respect to their temporal constraints. 

This verification is done on the server-side of the tool TimeAwareBPMN-js. 
The tool was designed to be extended, by adding verification programs as plug-ins.
This version contains a plug-in that connects with the Java tool CSTNU to evaluate the dynamic controllability. 

This implementation is based on the examples: [properties-panel-extension with custom properties](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-examples/tree/master/properties-panel-extension) and [custom-elements](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-examples/tree/master/custom-elements).

### Editing temporal properties 

We extend the properties panel to allow editing `temporal properties` on BPMN elements. 
The temporal properties, like `tempcon:minDuration`, will be persisted as an extension as part of the BPMN 2.0 document:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<bpmn2:definitions ... xmlns:tempcon="https://gitlab.com/univr.di/TimeAwareBPMN" id="sample-diagram">
  <bpmn2:process id="Process_1">
    <bpmn2:userTask id="StartEvent_1" tempcon:minDuration="2" />
  </bpmn2:process>
  ...
</bpmn2:definitions>
```

See an [example](examples/diagram.bpmn).


Here we list the enhanced elements and the added attributes with examples. 

|**Activities**| (User Task, Service Task, Script Task, Send Task, and Receive Task)|
|---|---|
Added attributes | minDuration (default: 0), maxDuration (default: Inf), and propositionalLabel
Example | `tempcon:minDuration="1" tempcon:maxDuration="6" tempcon:propositionalLabel="R"`|

|**Intermediate catching events**| (Timer, Message, and Signal)|
|---|---|
Added attributes | minDuration, maxDuration, and propositionalLabel
Example | `tempcon:minDuration="1" tempcon:maxDuration="4" tempcon:propositionalLabel="Â¬R"`|

|**Parallel gateways**| |
|---|---|
Added attributes | minDuration, maxDuration, propositionalLabel, and gatewaySplitJoin
| Example | `tempcon:minDuration="2" tempcon:maxDuration="4" tempcon:propositionalLabel="" tempcon:gatewaySplitJoin="split" ` |

|**Exclusive gateways**| |
|---|---|
Added attributes | minDuration, maxDuration, propositionalLabel, gatewaySplitJoin, and observedProposition|
| Example | `tempcon:minDuration="2" tempcon:maxDuration="4" tempcon:propositionalLabel="" tempcon:gatewaySplitJoin="split" tempcon:observedProposition="R" ` |

|**Sequence flow**| |
|---|---|
Added attributes | minDuration (default: 0), maxDuration (default: Inf), and isTrueBranch
| Example | `tempcon:minDuration="1" tempcon:maxDuration="2" tempcon:isTrueBranch="true"` |

### Inter-task constraint

We created a custom connection called `inter-task` that sets temporal constraints between any pair of elements in the diagram. These relative constraints are a general concept in temporal verification methods, but they are not part of the BPMN standard. Because of this, we implemented it as a custom object independent of the BPMN model. It is kept in a different file and can be used to generate temporal constraints models.  
The editor loads and saves files with the information of the inter-tasks. 

The attributes of inter-task elements are: type ("custom:connection"), id, waypoints, source, target, intertaskConnFrom (default: end), intertaskConnTo (default: start), and propositionalLabel. 
This is an example of an inter-task JSON file. 

```
[
	{
		"type": "custom:connection",
		"id": "InterTask_7y18aromoa7loumv4omkrjz6e",
		"waypoints": [
			{"x": 220, "y": 220},
			{"x": 220, "y": 360},
			{"x": 580, "y": 360},
			{"x": 580, "y": 220}
		],
		"source": "T1",
		"target": "T4",
		"minDuration": "2",
		"maxDuration": "18",
		"propositionalLabel": "S",
		"intertaskConnFrom": "start",
		"intertaskConnTo": "end"
	}
]
```

### Toolbar to select the verification tool

We created a toolbar that loads and exposes the plug-ins, that communicate with the corresponding plug-in in the server, which can interact with desktop applications to perform the verifications of the models. 

## Running the Example

The TimeAwareBPMN-editor is loaded by the TimeAwareBPMN-js tool. It is possible to execute it alone to edit models, but without performing the verification of temporal constraints. 

Install all required dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Build and run the project

```
npm run dev
```

## Troubleshooting

To build and run the project it is required `grunt`. For Windows this is not installed globally, which can be done with the command: 
```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```
